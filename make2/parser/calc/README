This scanner and parse generator pair used here is the C++ version of flex and
bion, namely, flexc++ and bisonc++. As of 11/11/2014, flexc++ and bisonc++ are
not available on MacOSX.

Due to the complexity involved in generating the scanner and parser, the 'make
clean' command just deletes everything. It is also highly recommended that you
'make clean' before 'make all' even with the slightest modification.
