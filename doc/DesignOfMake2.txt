			Context Free Grammar of the New Makefile


assignment -> var := rhs | var += rhs | var -= rhs

rhs -> fnames | vars | rhs [vars fnames]

vars -> var | vars var

var -> $(string) | ${string}

fnames -> (empty) | fname | fnames fname

fname -> (\w|\/\/)[\w\d\.\/]

letter -> [a-z] | [A-Z]

digit -> [0-9]

rule -> fname : rhs recipe
      | fname : recipe
      | fname : rhs

pattern_rule -> pattern : patterns
	| pattern : patterns recipe
	| pattern : recipe

pattern -> .*%.*

recipe -> ^\t.*

Line extension using backslash '/' is done in the preprocessing stage. The
preprocessor removes the backslash, any trailing spaces, tabs, and the newline
character '\n', concatenate the ensuring line with all spaces and tabs removed
