Please read the LinuxKernelCodingStyle.txt first. If you do not believe it's
right, please just convince yourself it's true.

The Linux kernel coding style is restricted to the C programming language. It
should be carried over to the C++ programming language without any doubt. I am
here to lay out some rules that I found most useful for C++ programs as well.

If your project uses some other coding style, follow that. Being a team player
is more important to adhering to some nerdy doctrine, even when the doctrine is
really better.
