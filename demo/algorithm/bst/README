C-style implementation of AVL tree without parent pointers

Supported operations:
	search
	insert
	delete
	traverse:
		recursive: pre/in/post order
		stack    : pre/in/post order
		morris   : pre/in order
		debug    : pre/in/post order, implemented using stack
		level order, level order with debug information

This implementation does not recursion in search/insert/delete. For traversal,
insertion is only used when BST_RECURSIVE is specified.
